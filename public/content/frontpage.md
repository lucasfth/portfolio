The ones everyday people consider languages and the coding kinds.
These are the ones I know.

### Normal languages

- 🇩🇰 Danish - Native
- 🇬🇧 English - Professional
- 🇪🇸 Spanish - Elementary

### Programming languages

The programming languages I know are highlighted on my GitHub (thus I only have to update the languages in one place). I've included my profile [here](https://github.com/lucasfth).

## 🎓 Education

### Bachelor in Software Development

**[IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk/)** - *(aug 2021 → jul 2024)*\
Gained a solid software development foundation, focusing on theoretical and practical aspects as well.
Completed coursework in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles.
Worked on various projects, including a DHI project that involved developing a full-stack web application.
My bachelor thesis was about hand gestures in virtual meetings, and if there exists a natural gesture set that can be mapped to actions such as volume control. ⚠️Spoiler: There was not a natural gesture set.
But we got a lot of other interesting findings from the data we gathered and analyzed.
