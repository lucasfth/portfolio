# Aperture

Why aperture? Well in my spare time, I enjoy photography and dabble in videography. This website was mainly meant as a professional portfolio but I also wanted to include my photography. So the word "Portfolio" was taken and thus, I chose "Aperture" as the name. Here you can see a selection of moments I have captured. I am still finding my style of photography but I like the idea of capturing moody, minimalistic, or something which looks to have texture.
