# ðŸ“« My first blog post

Welcome to my first blog post. The purpose of this blog is to share thoughts, experiences, and insights I have gathered. So a lot of the posts will also be about what I find useful and interesting in my own daily life.

---

## What to expect

I will be writing about multiple topics, including but not limited to; programming, technology, photography, and personal development. As I am both a part-time developer, nearly full-time student, amateur photographer, and involved in various volunteering organizations, I will also be sharing my experiences in these areas.

## Why even create this blog?

The short answer is that it serves both personal and altruistic purposes.
Sometimes I discover small life hacks or efficient ways to do things that I may forget or not use for a while.
By writing them down, I can always revisit and benefit from them.
Additionally, I want to share my experiences and thoughts with others, hoping that they might find it useful and interesting.

I hope you get something out of the posts I write.
If you have questions, feedback, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me either in email, found below, or in the comments section of the posts.
