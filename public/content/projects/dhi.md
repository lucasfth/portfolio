## GreenUP Project

During my fourth semester at ITU, I had the valuable opportunity to collaborate with DHI on the GreenUP project, a pivotal experience in my software development and agile methodologies learning journey. This immersive project allowed me to apply Scrum methodologies in a near real-world setting, working closely with DHI and fellow ITU students to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that addresses the challenges of urban planning and promotes sustainability.

As a team, we focused on understanding the needs of urban planners, engaging in collaborative discussions and iterative development cycles to craft an MVP that incorporates scenario-based modeling and satellite-based information. This approach aimed to facilitate more informed decision-making in urban planning processes.

One of the highlights of the GreenUP project was the creation of a video presentation showcasing our prototype. Which you can watch by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoQ5T-fo3Qc).

I am proud of the achievements we made on the GreenUP project and grateful for the invaluable lessons I learned through this collaboration. The experience equipped me with practical skills and insights that continue to inform my journey as a software developer.
