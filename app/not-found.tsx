          Or you can stay here to read more about my personal hobbies and
          interests. These are the ones that I have either not mentioned on the
          main pages or simply just not elaborated on in detail.

        <h2>ðŸ¥Š Training</h2>
        <p>
          After many years of strength training I hit a plateau. This could of
          course had been solved by making a more structured program and use
          more time. But I also at the same time wished to learn something new.
          <br />
          So small two years into my bachelors I looked up martial arts close to
          me, as it also looked like a sport where people have a lot more
          respect for each other. I started looking into MMA, but found nothing
          close to me. After some searching I finally found a gym which offered
          Muay Thai classes. I thus took my first trial class and quickly fell
          in love with the sport.
          <br />
          It was nice to finally not just get challenged mentally from uni work,
          but also physically by the training. I have now been training Muay
          Thai since summer 2023, and I have not only found a sport I love, but
          also a community which is very welcoming and friendly. Even though it
          may sound weird, I think that due to the knowledge that the one you
          are sparring with can hurt you it makes you more careful, honest and
          thus more respectful.
          <br />
          So I definely recommend trying out martial arts if you are looking for
          a new sport. Most places do not just teach you how to fight, but also
          how teach you implicitly how to be a better person.

        <h2>ðŸ“· Photography</h2>
        <p>
          Photography is something I have always been fascinated by. But I have
          never really understood how people could take images that were not
          just a snapshot of a moment, but they could instead tell a story or a
          feeling.
          <br />
          In late 2022 I bought my first camera, a Fujifilm X-E4. I have then
          since experimented with what I enjoy taking pictures of. The first
          images I took were quite boring, and I it did not feel like nothing
          was communicated trough them. But as I look back I already do see what
          I wanted to portray.
          <br />I have always felt like people might not understand me, and I
          have always been a bit of an outsider. Thus most my personal images
          display some kind of feeling of loneliness. Not that it is a bad
          thing, since it can also be peaceful, and you have time to reflect.
